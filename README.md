# ATNN-project
Advanced Topics in Network Neuroscience project.

## Description

### Keypoints
1. Considering healthy subjects (for now only data available already preprocessed), we can focus on subject specific (eg. 1 subject)
2. We consider the SC of that subject and run a community detection (e.g. Leuvain algo)
3. Keeping in mind the communites from Structure, we can compute FC dinamically (e.g. sliding windows) and see how graph metrics (TBD) change in time in task or Resting State

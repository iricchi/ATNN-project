Presentation Outline:

1/ Intro:
    - Modularity is useful to characterize topology of a graph
    - but results are highly dependent on community definition
    - We want to investigate the impact of using different communities in the analysis of a fMRI with motor tasks
    - Specifically, look at communities extracted from Louvain on FC, SC

2/ Dataset:
    - Show FC, experimental paradigm, SC

3/ Community detection
    - show the strategies
   
4/ Our definition of hubbiness

5/ Fig1A and B: big matrix (90xtime) of variation of hubbiness over time
Fig2 difference between partitions in CV (scatter plot of CV of hubbiness FP vs SP)

6/ One way ANOVA on the hubbinness for both partitions

7/ Visualization of best regions 

8/ Classification using selected features to predict the task

9/ Conclusion
